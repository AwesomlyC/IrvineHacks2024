By 2030, it is estimated that diabetes will affect 54.9 million Americans, marking a 54% increase from 2015 to 2030. This upward trend amplifies the risk of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels), as individuals increasingly rely on daily insulin usage to manage their condition. Hypoglycemia poses serious consequences, such as coma, seizures, brain impairment, and even death. Given the seriousness of this disease, strictly monitoring glucose levels and insulin intakes is essential. However, doing so is neither an enjoyable nor intuitive process.
